# Cardo-et-al-2021
Scripts for analysis of raw sequencing data and differential gene expression for the SETBP1 paper from Lucia F. Cardo. 


To use:

  - Edit param.txt file to specify the genome assembly, the read length, number of samples and versions of each module to load into Raven.

Each script is run sequentially for each group (e.g. all 01_* scripts can be run at the same time). Once they are done, the next set of scripts can be run.
