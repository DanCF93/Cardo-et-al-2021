#Differential Gene Expression

The script for DEG is in bin/ and contains all the information to produce the DEG for multiple samples by just sourcing the script (although it can also be run manyally in R).

The directory (folder) for the analysis should have the following architecture:

- Analysis
-   /bin
-   /input
-   /output
-   /resources

where
- bin: contains cript for DEG.
- input: contains the .txt files with raw counts for each sample or samples to be compared.
- output: will store all the output files (DEG and QC plots).
- resources: tab delimited file where each line contains all the required information from your samples. The sampleNames need to match the column names of the input files (not necesarely in the same order).
